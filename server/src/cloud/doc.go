/*

Goals:
1. Some sort of deployment. Make deployment easy, as in - scripts. Don't depend on the host.
Do this then first.

deploy.sh
and then, ui(html), make sure is deployed.

Back to the idea.
$main_dir has meta.json inside,
which can be user, or whatever.
or, even known types by known names.
for example:
/user.json - it is a user
/company.json - company

where user.json can refer to the company.

Then additional hash tables can help in navigation. Let's see.
